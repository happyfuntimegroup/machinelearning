# Machine Learning Challenge of Tilburg University

In this challenge the task is to predict the number of citations a scientific paper
receives based on its abstract and metadata.

## ISSUES

Under [issues](https://github.com/happyfuntimegoup/machinelearning/issues), we can create about different tasks that we're working on and issues we have encountered (e.g. an funtion that supposedly works for one person, doesn't work for the other). 
If a function/assignment is completed, you can close the issues, so we all know it has been completed. An update on Whatsapp would also be appreciated! :)

## Tasks
We can update each other about current tasks that we came up with. Use strikethrough ('\~~(text)\~~') to show it has been completed.

## The end
Top 14!
